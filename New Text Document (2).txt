Create a Reactcomponent called `CommentSection` that displays 
a section with nested comments. 
Each comment should have a `username` and `text` property. 
The `CommentSection` component should receive a `comments`                                 
array as a prop, where each comment is represented                                           
                                                                                            
by an object with `username` and `text` properties.

The `CommentSection` component should render each 
comment in a visually appealing way, 
with the username displayed in bold and the comment 
text displayed below it. 
Additionally, each comment should have a nested `ReplySection` 
component that allows users to reply to that specific comment.

I'm feeling extra generous today
























Good morning. Please come in and sit down. Well, what's wrong with him?



 Good morning. I don’t feel so well…. I have a pain in my tummy which
spreads to my back. 


When did these symptoms start? Does it hurt more when you do
physical exertion or were you at rest when the pain began?


: It was…three days ago and I wasn’t making an effort at all, in fact, I was
at rest, sleeping and suddenly I felt so much pain... At first I thought it was indigestion
because I had a big meal and the food I ate was really greasy. The day after I believed I
could be constipated but in the afternoon I started to have nausea and I felt really hot.
